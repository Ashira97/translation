1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,530
what we create runs everywhere it's

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,849
literally used everywhere in the world

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,919
today without the passion the internet

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,180
that we know today would not have

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,669
happened the best database the best

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,349
streaming framework we're creating

00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,220
industry's programming for fat people

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,409
it's a great group of people it's

people from China people from Europe it

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,940
doesn't matter what language you speak

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,568
where you come from

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,120
Apache is really good at bringing people

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,159
together and letting them work together

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,709
without companies getting in the way try

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:37,779
to learn something from everybody every

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,750
day inspiring it makes me want to be

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,329
better when working with people there

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,128
are so much better than yourself you

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,570
learn a lot community community in more

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,489
community people were so open and so

22
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,059
engaging and so excited to help don't be

23
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,669
afraid to give to share you would get

24
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:59,799
more out of it I've got more out of

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,169
Apache than I've ever given building

26
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,980
communities around people who are

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,000
passionate about solving problems create

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,969
incredibly passionate communities who

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,299
are then empowered to create incredibly

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,058
powerful software the software that

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,069
we've written how far it's gone and how

32
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,340
much it's used every day is staggering

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,849
I'm proud to be a part of an

34
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,349
organization that has changed the world

35
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,649
and I don't think many people understand

36
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,659
exactly how Apache has changed the world

37
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,579
it's impacted everyone when there's

38
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,230
something now you know people can touch

39
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,480
and you know act with their phones in

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,429
their car and you know you realize all

41
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,739
of us open-source software and it's like

42
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,049
wow okay this is something that's truly

43
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,039
changed the world

44
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,009
you know it's more than just technology

45
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,679
it's more than just coding it's bringing

46
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,730
new ideas new aspects there's so much

47
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,399
more we can do with the technology we

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,439
already have that is something that's

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,399
that's amazing

50
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,709
with the foundation that is something

51
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,259
it's so exciting and that is the thing

52
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,420
that really sort of keeps me interested

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,100
in and I'm passionate about

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,890
there's still so much work to do so like

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,340
I'm gonna be busy for a while I think

56
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,580
doing this kind of work and and I hope

57
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,500
many other people are too

58
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,390
the best software in the world I mean

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,459
that's the ASF

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,139
